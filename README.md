This is done to prevent memory leaks when working with dynamically allocated memory in C.                                                                                                                                                          | libft/string/ft_free_split.c   |
| ft_splitcharset.c | The provided code snippet is a C function that splits a string into an array of strings using a given set of delimiter characters. It first counts the number of strings to be created, then allocates memory for the result array. It then iterates through the original string, extracting and copying each substring until it has created all the required strings. Finally, the function returns a null-terminated array of strings.                                        | libft/string/ft_splitcharset.c |
| ft_strmapi.c      | The provided code snippet is a function named "__strmapi" that takes a string and a function as input and returns a new string after applying the function to each character of the original string. The function creates a new string, applies the function to each character, and returns the new string. The function checks for null values and allocates sufficient memory for the new string.                                                                             | libft/string/ft_strmapi.c      |
| ft_strtrim.c      | The provided code snippet contains a function called "__strtrim" that takes two arguments, a string and a set of characters. The function trims the string by removing any characters that are in the set at the beginning and end of the string. It then returns the trimmed string as a new string. The function uses helper functions to check if a character is in the set and to allocate memory for the new string.                                                       | libft/string/ft_strtrim.c      |
| ft_strlcat.c      | The code defines a function called __strlcat that takes a destination string, a source string, and a size_t value as input parameters. The function appends the source string to the destination string and returns the length of the concatenated string. The function also checks for buffer overflow and ensures that the concatenated string is null-terminated.                                                                                                            | libft/string/ft_strlcat.c      |
| ft_strdup.c       | The code provides two functions: `__strdup` and `__strndup`, both of which duplicate a given string. `__strdup` duplicates the entire string while `__strndup` does so up to a given length. Both functions allocate memory for the new strings using `malloc` and return a pointer to the duplicated string.                                                                                                                                                                   | libft/string/ft_strdup.c       |
| ft_isalnum.c      | The code snippet is a function named "__isalnum" that checks whether a given character is alpha-numeric or not. The function calls two other functions "__isalpha" and "__isdigit" to check if the character is alphabetic or a digit respectively, and returns 1 if the character is either one of them, or 0 otherwise.                                                                                                                                                       | libft/string/ft_isalnum.c      |
| ft_tolower.c      | The provided code contains a function "__tolower" that takes an integer as input and converts it to its lowercase equivalent. The function checks if the input is within the range of uppercase ASCII values and adds 32 to get the lowercase equivalent. Otherwise, it returns the input as is. The code includes the necessary header file "libft.h".                                                                                                                         | libft/string/ft_tolower.c      |
| ft_strcmp.c       | The provided code snippet contains two functions for comparing strings: "__strcmp" and "__strcmp_ignore_case". The "__strcmp" function compares two strings character by character, returning the difference between the first pair that differs. The "__strcmp_ignore_case" function does the same, but ignores differences in case by calling an internal function "__tolower".                                                                                               | libft/string/ft_strcmp.c       |
